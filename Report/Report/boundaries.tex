\label{sec:Boundaries}
To limit the scope of this project, a MoSCoW analysis has been used to define and prioritise features of the product.

\section{Plan}
To limit the project a plan of complete projects are is as follows:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Pure sine corrected to the nearest of two tones.
	\item Chirp corrected to the nearest of two tones.
	\item Chirp corrected to C major.
	\item Voice fundamental frequency corrected to C major.
	\item Voice fundamental, first and third harmonic, corrected to C major.
\end{itemize}
