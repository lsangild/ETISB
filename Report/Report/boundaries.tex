\chapter{Development Plan}
To be able to investigate more methods, the project has been split up into stages, each aiming to bring the project closer to the end result of an auto tuner.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Pure sine corrected to the nearest of two tones.
	\item Chirp corrected to the nearest of two tones.
	\item Chirp corrected to C major.
	\item Handling up to third harmonic being the dominant frequency.
	\item Voice fundamental frequency corrected to C major.
	\item Voice fundamental, first and third harmonic, corrected to C major.
	\item Remove noise and correct voice to C major.
\end{itemize}
