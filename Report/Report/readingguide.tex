The report will start with a description of the requirements for the system and a use case for how the system can be used and in what context the system is thought to be used in.
After the requirements there will be a plan for the project.
The plan is made to show, how the different steps in the development process will be, with many small goals, that will increase in difficulty.

After the planning, the project will start with the first goal in the plan, to pitch shift a pure sine. 
Here all the thoughts will be described, and a analysis, design, modelling, implementation and test is written for this goal. 
The next goal in the planning to pitch shift a tone, is then described with possible solutions and ideas as well as problems.
There are appendix which will be referenced to, for example to see the Matlab code for the modelling section. 

Lastly a discussion of the hole project has been made with a following conclusion to round the project off.
