\chapter{Modelling and implementation}
\label{sec:modelandimpl}
\fxnote{Description of Matlab model AND CrossCore implementation in correct sections.}
The modelling and implementation of this project will be done in steps, allowing the team to find and eliminate issues along the way, while still having a product to show as long as the first implementation has been completed.

The implementation steps are
\begin{itemize}
	\item Pitch shift single sine
	\item Pitch shift C-major tone
	\item Pitch shift real music
\end{itemize}
