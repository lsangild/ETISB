\section{Analysis}
\fxnote{Description of the problem and how to solve it.}
The issue of changing the frequency of a pure sine wave can be handled in a number of ways:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Changing the sampling frequency.
	\item Create a new sine at the target frequency, without changing the sampling frequency.
	\item Interpolating or decimating the input (only works if $f_{target}=\frac{f_{meas}}{n}\vee f_{target} =n\cdot f_{meas}$, where $n$ is an integer greater than zero.)
\end{itemize}

The first option is chosen for the first implementation, and is described in \cref{sec:PureSineModelling}.
